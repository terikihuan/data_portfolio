# Data Analysis Portfolio
This is a portfolio to showcase my data analysis projects

## Kaggle projects
### [Microsoft Stock Price ARIMA analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/terikihuan/microsoft-stock-arima-forecast)
In this project, I explore and analyze the closing stock price of Microsoft. This small project is for me to learn about time series analysis, perticularly ARIMA (and other flavor like SARIMA). Here I learned to perform some basic EDA, process the data to make it stationary (using log transformation/Box-Cox transformation), read ACF/PACF plot to choose the appropriate ARIMA model.

### [Rohlik Sales Forecasting Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/code/terikihuan/sales-forecasting)
In this Kaggle challenge, I used LightGBM (Gradient Boosting model) to predict sales. This challenge is very fun and it forces me to step out of my comfort zone and try new machine learning models. The model choice here is because of the data (there are many different predictors). Here I performed more advanced EDA, and developed a LightGBM model.

## Tableau Viz
### [New York City Transit Customer Support Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Huan_NYCT_Viz/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
This is a simple dashboard created from the New York City Transit Customer Support public dataset. The dashboard contains some KPIs such as Call Answer Rate, Wait Time, etc. It also contains graph to show capacity and peak time/period.
